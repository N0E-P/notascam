							Patrick Colins is the genius who did the 16H training I took. And on May
							26, 2022, he's sending out a new gigantic training on Solidity with
							Javascript, of <span className="font-bold">32 HOURS!!!</span>
						</p>
						<p className="py-2 text-gray-700 ">
							I knew that it would take me a long time to follow it. But I also knew
							that if I really wanted to become a developer, I had to know how to use
							Javascript.
						</p>
						<p className="py-2 text-gray-700 ">
							So I started at the beginning of July, and a month and a half of hard
							work later, I finally finished this endless course. Moreover, to prove
							that we had finished it, we had to use all the knowledge of the course
							to mint 5 NFT as puzzles. It was far from being simple, but once
							finished, I was damn proud of myself!

							<span className="underline">Fun fact:</span> As I'm writing this, I am one
