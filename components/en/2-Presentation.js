              I started with Lego. I used to stay in my garden shed all the

              Later, I discovered Minecraft. It was a whole new world of

              One day, my father bought some Arduino. There are small cards that
              you can program and link with anything and everything. I had a lot
              of fun playing with them.

              I was doing pretty well, even though I was just copying and

            On July 27, 2021, I had the misfortune to fall into the world of
            cryptocurrencies

          <p className="sm:mx-10 my-2 md:text-center py-3 p-4">

          <p className="sm:mx-10 my-2 p-4 ">
            I bought cryptos that didn't make sense, I played trader when I
            didn't know anything about it, and I lost unbelievable amounts of
            money just on transaction fees. In short, I managed to make all my
            money disappear without seeing anything coming!

            Fortunately, I was lucky enough not to have given up and got back
            into it 3 months later. That's when I really started to understand
            the ecosystem and became interested in the whole technology aspect
            behind the blockchain.

            But since I didn't make any more money, I continued to look for a
            way to make some

            Then, around mid-February 2022, I participated in{" "}

            that my older sister had to do for her engineering school. That's when I noticed that I really liked programming, and I was doing pretty well too! It was elected the best project of the year by the jury.

            Not long before, I heard about the Solidity developer job. The
            programming language for creating smart contracts and interacting
            with the blockchain. Then I realized that it mixed two things I
            particularly liked: programming and blockchain.
